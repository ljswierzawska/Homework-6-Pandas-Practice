# Homework-6-Pandas-Practice

This repository contains introductory exercises to Pandas. With a use of databases on animals and billionaires, the script included in the two Jupyter Notebooks is a basic analysis that helps to understand and explore the data. 

This project is a part of a class module Foundations of Computing at Columbia Journalism School.
